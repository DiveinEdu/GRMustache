GRMustache for iPhone 5
=======================

This branch contains a static library `libGRMustache5-iOS.a` that contains armv7 and armv7s slices that is suitable for linking GRMustache with Xcode 4.5, and target iOS4, iOS5, iOS6, and the iPhone 5.

Support is dropped for iPhone 3G and iPod Touch 2nd generation.

Check [https://github.com/groue/GRMustache](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache) for the regular armv6+armv7 GRMustache.
